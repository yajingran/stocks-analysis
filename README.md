Analysis on green stocks

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve pick a green stock based on its past performance. To achieve this, we set up a system for Steve where he can easily compare the past performance on each of the stocks (ticker symbols) by extracting data on total daily volume and percentage of return. We have also set up a timer function to give Steve a better understanding on how long exactly will it take for the system to give reesults.
